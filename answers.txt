Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git can help keep track of changes in code. This makes it easier to collaborate with others and allows programmers to revert to earlier versions of code if something stops working.
Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can benefit environmental science by analyzing large datasets to monitor environmental changes. For example, predictive models can be used to forecast air pollution levels, helping cities implement measures to improve air quality.
Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging will combine changes from one branch into another while preserving the commit histories from both branches. Rebasing instead rewrites the history commit-by-commit to create a linear path. In general rebasing results in a cleaner commit history but doesn't preserving the original branching.
